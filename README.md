# Description of the materials in this repository 

In this repository you will find: 
- A folder called `src` in which I stored the data I used to implement the R code. Indeed, usually one should write in the code a variable storing the link of the data. However, in the [website where I found the data](https://dappradar.com/ethereum/games/the-sandbox) there was not a link correspondent to the file I wanted to download, so that I had to manually downaload the data and add in the code the path for those specific data. Hence, if you want to run the code, you can download the file in the `src` folder and change the line of code with your path for those file.
- A folder called `R code and images` in which I sotred the lines of code used to draw the time-series of Daily Active Users and Makret capitalization, and the results as png images (if you run the code in RStudio, you will have more interactive plots) 
- A pdf file called `Details about the report` in which I reported only the materials and reasonaments that I used to reach the conclusions I wrote in the report. 
- A pdf file called `Issues in the system`, created only to explain why I state that an increase in the number of Creators could cause issues if Players do not follow the trend.
